What is business Intelligenc
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the processes, technologies, and tools used to collect, analyze, and present data to support business decision-making. It involves gathering and transforming raw data into meaningful and actionable insights, which can be used by organizations to make informed strategic, tactical, and operational decisions.

The goal of business intelligence is to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's data, enabling managers, executives, and other stakeholders to gain insights into various aspects of the business. By leveraging BI, companies can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends, identify opportunities, and address challenges more effectively.

Business intelligence encompasses several activities, including:

Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, applications, spreadsheets, and external systems.

Data Integration: Combining data from different sources and transforming it into a unified format suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis: Applying statistical and analytical techniques to identify patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. This process involves using tools like data mining, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Reporting and Dashboards: Presenting data in a visual and interactive manner through reports, charts, graphs, and dashboards. These visual representations make it easier for users to understand and interpret complex information.

Querying and Ad hoc Analysis: Allowing users to explore and analyze data on-demand by querying databases or using self-service BI tools.

Performance Monitoring: Continuously tracking KPIs and monitoring business performance against predefined goals or benchmarks.

Data Warehousing: Storing large volumes of structured and organized data in a central repository (data warehouse) to facilitate reporting and analysis.

Data Governance and Security: Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and security through proper governance practices, data quality controls, and access controls.

Business intelligence is widely used across industries to support decision-making processes related to areas such as sales and marketing, finance, operations, supply chain management, and customer relationship management. The insights derived from BI can guide strategic planning, improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive overall business performance.

for this question Define BI and what is the need of Business Intelligence below is the answer/solution summerize me

What drives the desire for instituting a BI program? And more to the point, what are
the primary drivers for business analytics and how can the benefits be effectively
communicated to the important organizational stakeholders?
A straightforward approach for considering the value of a BI program looks at
business processes, their source of derived or generated value, performance
measures, and where the absence of knowledge impedes the complete achievement of business success. By categorizing dimensions of business value, we can
then evaluate the ways that BI can contribute to increased performance along those dimensions. A high-level overview suggests at least these dimensions of
value:
n Financial value associated with increased profitability, whether derived from lowered costs or increased revenues;
n Productivity value associated with increased throughput with decreased workloads,
diminished time for executing end-to-end processes (such as manufacturing or
operational workflows), and increasing the percentage of high quality products
or outcomes;
n Trust value, such as greater customer, employee, or supplier satisfaction, as well
as increasing confidence in forecasting, maintaining consistent operational and
management reports, reductions in time spent in ‘‘analysis paralysis,’’ and better
results from decisions; and
n Risk value associated with improved visibility into credit exposure, confidence in
capital and asset investments, and auditable compliance with jurisdictional and
industry standards and regulations.
Of course, there are many other benefits to building a BI practice within an
organization. Some benefits are focused on the ability to answer what might be
considered the most basic questions about how a company does business. For
example, it is surprising how few senior managers within a company can answer
simple questions about their business, such as:
n How many employees do you have?
n For each product, how many were sold over the last 12 months within each
geographic region?
n Who are your 10 best customers?
n What is the value of any particular customer?
n Who are your 20 best suppliers?
What is even more interesting is that in some organizations, not only can we not
answerthese questions, there may not even be a framework in which someone can even
ask these questions. There is a critical point to be made here: Starting a well-conceived
and comprehensive BI program that engages both the technical practitioners and the
business consumers will not just provide the physical tools for answering these kinds of
questions, but, more importantly, should be a catalyst for changing the way team
members think about doing business and about how information is a critical catalyst for
closing the loop by taking action and measuring the outcomes of those actions.
For example, before we can determine who the 20 best customers are, we must be
able to articulate the difference between a ‘‘good’’ and a ‘‘bad’’ customer, as well as
be able to identify a collection of metrics used to measure goodness, what data sets
need to be collected for measurement, establish and integrate the methods for collecting and aggregating the data used for measuring, establish the processes required for conducting the measurement, ensure the quality of that data so as to not draw
faulty conclusions, package the results into a reasonable report, and find a method to
quickly and effectively disseminate the results of this process.
Although a lot of this process may be automated using off-the-shelf technology,
the most important part (i.e., asking the right question) needs input from individuals
with expertise and a stake in the result. It again reinforces the need for supporting the
growing utility of multipurposed data. Correspondingly, there is a growing
community of individuals willing to consider data as a corporate asset that can be
manipulated in different ways to derive benefit along the key value drivers.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


The primary drivers for instituting a Business Intelligence (BI) program and the benefits of business analytics can be effectively communicated to important organizational stakeholders through a comprehensive understanding of the value BI brings to the business. By categorizing dimensions of business value, it becomes easier to evaluate how BI can contribute to increased performance in those areas. Some key dimensions of value include:

Financial value: BI can help increase profitability by identifying opportunities for cost reduction or revenue growth.

Productivity value: BI enables increased throughput, decreased workloads, and improved quality, resulting in higher productivity and efficiency in business processes.

Trust value: BI enhances customer, employee, and supplier satisfaction by providing accurate forecasting, consistent operational and management reports, and reducing time spent on analysis. It also leads to better decision-making and outcomes.

Risk value: BI provides improved visibility into credit exposure, confidence in capital and asset investments, and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.

In addition to these dimensions, there are other benefits of implementing a BI program. One crucial benefit is the ability to answer basic questions about the business. Many senior managers struggle to provide simple information about their company, such as the number of employees, product sales by region, top customers, or the value of specific customers. Establishing a BI program not only provides the tools to answer these questions but also changes the way team members think about doing business and leveraging information.

Starting a comprehensive BI program involves engaging both technical practitioners and business consumers, creating a framework for asking and answering critical business questions. This process includes articulating the difference between good and bad customers, defining metrics for measurement, collecting and aggregating relevant data, ensuring data quality, generating reports, and disseminating results effectively. While technology can automate many aspects, the importance of asking the right questions and involving experts with a stake in the outcome remains crucial.

The growing utility of multipurpose data and the recognition of data as a corporate asset further emphasize the need to support and leverage BI practices. By effectively communicating the benefits and value drivers of BI, organizations can gain support and commitment from stakeholders, driving successful implementation and utilization of business intelligence initiatives.

for this question

What are the activities of BI or what are the reasons for the failure of any 
Business? answer is below please summarizea and add relevant information to write a 7 marks question in exam

The fact that you are reading this book implies that you are somehow involved in
some aspect of BI. You may be just curious and looking to learn more, or you may be
actively involved in some phase of a BI activity: the discovery phase, justification,
analysis of requirements for design, creation, management, maintenance, or development of a BI program. And it may also be likely that somewhere within your
corporate senior management hierarchy, there are individuals who have been
convinced of the value of starting a BI program. Unfortunately, the disparate
perceptions of what ‘‘business intelligence’’ means and how (or perhaps even ‘‘if’’)
the knowledge derived through BI is to be employed can contribute to delays, stalls,
and in some cases, overall program failure.
As with any technology investment, when we look at organizations that have
started implementing reporting engines, developing data warehouses, or have
purchased large-scale data mining software suites without any program management,
change agents, or business goals, we see high expectations and many disappointments
related to the failure in the way that data warehouse projects are conceived, designed,
architected, managed, and implemented, for any, if not all, of these reasons:
n The amorphous understanding of what BI methods and products could do
resulted in an absence of a proper perception of the value proposition on behalf
of the business sponsor.
n The absence of clear measures of success masked the value of specific milestones
and deliverables.
n A communications gap between the implementers and the end users prevented the
integration of information requirements into the system development life cycle.
n The scope of the project was not fully understood, causing delays in delivering to
the business sponsor.
n Insufficient technical training prevented developers from getting software products to do what the vendors said they do.
n Attempting to incorporate many inconsistent data sources failed because of variance in formats, structures, and semantics.
n Poor understanding of technology infrastructure led to poor planning and
scheduling.
n Business users were unable to trust results due to poor data quality.
n The lack of a clear statement of success criteria, along with a lack of ways to
measure program success, led to a perception of failure.
The goal of this book is to provide a high-level overview of the technical (and
some political) concepts for which a savvy manager must have awareness when
involved in a BI or information exploitation project in order to make that project
successful. The material is intended to cast interesting technology in an operational
business framework while providing the introductory technical background and
highlighting important topics such as:
n Management issues
n Managing change
n Technical issues
n Performance issues
n Complexity
This book will describe the basic architectural components of a BI environment,
beginning with traditional topics, such as business process modeling and data
modeling, and moving on to more modern topics, such as business rule systems, data
profiling, information compliance and data quality, data warehousing, and data
mining. My hope is that this will be a valuable introduction to the technology,
management issues, and terminology of the BI industry. But first, let’s settle on
a definition of business intelligence.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


The activities of Business Intelligence (BI) involve various phases and tasks aimed at gathering, analyzing, and utilizing data to support decision-making. Some key activities within BI include:

Discovery Phase: This involves identifying the business objectives, understanding data sources, and determining the scope of the BI initiative.

Justification: Assessing the potential value and benefits of implementing BI, including cost savings, revenue growth, improved efficiency, and better decision-making.

Requirements Analysis: Identifying and analyzing the information needs of stakeholders, defining key performance indicators (KPIs), and determining data requirements for reporting and analysis.

Design and Development: Creating the architecture, data models, and infrastructure necessary for data storage, extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). Developing reports, dashboards, and analytical tools to present information to users.

Management and Maintenance: Implementing processes to ensure the ongoing management, governance, and maintenance of data quality, security, and performance. This includes monitoring data sources, resolving issues, and updating and enhancing the BI system as needed.

Communication and User Engagement: Ensuring effective communication and collaboration between the BI team and end-users to understand their requirements, provide training and support, and promote user adoption and engagement.

Failure in BI initiatives can occur due to various reasons, such as:

Lack of clear understanding of BI methods and value proposition by business sponsors, leading to unrealistic expectations and misalignment with business goals.

Absence of clear success measures and milestones, making it difficult to demonstrate the value and progress of the BI project.

Communication gaps between implementers and end-users, resulting in a disconnect between information requirements and system development.

Incomplete understanding of the project scope, causing delays and difficulties in delivering results to the business sponsors.

Insufficient technical training, hindering developers from effectively utilizing software tools and technologies.

Challenges in integrating disparate and inconsistent data sources with varying formats, structures, and semantics.

Inadequate planning and scheduling due to poor understanding of the technology infrastructure required for BI.

Issues with data quality leading to a lack of trust in the results generated by the BI system.

Absence of clear success criteria and measurement mechanisms, resulting in a perception of failure even if the BI project delivers value.

In an exam, a potential 7-mark question could be:

Discuss the activities involved in a Business Intelligence (BI) program and provide reasons for the failure of BI initiatives. Include key aspects such as the discovery phase, requirements analysis, design and development, management and maintenance, communication and user engagement. Additionally, explain the challenges and factors that contribute to the failure of BI initiatives, such as lack of understanding of BI methods, poor communication, incomplete scope definition, inadequate technical training, and data quality issues.

what are the reasons for the failure of any 
Business
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


The failure of a business can be attributed to various factors, both internal and external. Here are some common reasons for business failure:

Lack of Market Demand: One of the primary reasons for business failure is a lack of sufficient market demand for the product or service being offered. If there is little or no demand for what the business is providing, it becomes challenging to generate revenue and sustain operations.

Poor Planning and Strategy: Inadequate planning, including lack of a solid business plan, market research, and competitive analysis, can lead to poor decision-making and ineffective strategies. Without a clear direction and well-defined goals, a business may struggle to navigate the market successfully.

Inadequate Financial Management: Poor financial management, such as insufficient capital, cash flow problems, high debt, or inadequate financial controls, can severely impact a business's viability. Without proper financial planning and oversight, a business may struggle to meet its financial obligations and sustain operations.

Ineffective Leadership and Management: Incompetent or ineffective leadership can significantly contribute to business failure. Lack of vision, poor decision-making, inability to adapt to market changes, or ineffective management of resources and personnel can hinder a business's growth and success.

Failure to Adapt to Market Changes: Markets are dynamic and constantly evolving. Businesses that fail to adapt to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies, industry trends, or competitive landscapes may become obsolete or lose their competitive edge.

Strong Competition: Intense competition in the market can pose significant challenges for a business. If competitors offer better products, services, pricing, or customer experiences, a business may struggle to attract and retain customers, leading to failure.

Operational Inefficiencies: Inefficient operations, including poor supply chain management, ineffective production processes, inadequate quality control, or high operational costs, can erode a business's profitability and competitiveness.

Lack of Innovation and Differentiation: Businesses that fail to innovate or differentiate themselves from competitors may struggle to attract customers and create a unique value proposition. Stagnation and lack of innovation can lead to declining market share and ultimately business failure.

Legal and Regulatory Issues: Non-compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards can result in severe consequences for a business, including legal penalties, reputational damage, or loss of licenses and permits.

External Factors: Economic downturns, changes in government policies, natural disasters, or unforeseen events like pandemics can significantly impact businesses, leading to their failure.

It's important to note that these reasons for business failure are not exhaustive, and each business failure case may have unique contributing factors. Success in business requires careful planning, market analysis, effective management, financial prudence, adaptability, innovation, and the ability to navigate challenges effectively.

What are performance metrics and KPI (key performance indicator)
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Performance metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are both used to measure and evaluate the performance and success of a business or specific processes within an organization. Here's a brief explanation of each:

Performance Metrics:
Performance metrics are quantitative measures used to assess various aspects of a business's performance. These metrics provide objective data and insights into different areas of the organization. Performance metrics can be financial or non-financial and may include data related to revenue, costs, productivity, customer satisfaction, quality, efficiency, and more. These metrics are used to track progress, identify trends, and make informed decisions to improve overall performance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
KPIs are a subset of performance metrics and represent specific metrics that are considered critical to the success of an organization or a specific objective. KPIs are typically tied to strategic goals and objectives and provide a clear indication of whether the organization is on track to achieve its desired outcomes. KPIs are typically defined, measurable, and time-bound, allowing for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of performance. They help align the efforts of individuals and teams with organizational goals and enable focused decision-making.

KPIs vary across different industries and organizations depending on their specific objectives and priorities. For example, a retail business might use KPIs such as sales revenue, customer acquisition rate, customer retention rate, and average transaction value. A manufacturing company may focus on KPIs like production yield, on-time delivery, or product defect rate. In the field of customer service, KPIs could include average response time, customer satisfaction scores, or first-call resolution rate. The choice of KPIs depends on the strategic objectives and the areas of performance that are critical to the success of the organization.

Overall, performance metrics provide a broad set of data for assessing performance, while KPIs narrow the focus to key areas of importance, enabling organizations to monitor progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to drive success.
------------------
**You:**


summarize

Performance metrics measure how well we perform within a particular business
context. A performance metric relates an objective ‘‘score’’ (with a specific unit of
measures) within a subjective scale of success. As an example, we might have
a measure of the number of calls handled by each call center representative per hour.
The unit of measure is the ‘‘number of calls,’’ but this measure provides only an
objective score, but does not provide any subjective insight. Assessing comparative
performance means determining the expected number of calls to be handled per hour,
as well as specific target goals. To continue the example, the expected number of
calls to be handled is 10, while the target could be set at 15.
In the best scenarios, performance metrics are associated with every business
process. In turn, these performance metrics can be accumulated or aggregated into
higher-level metrics that describe a broader view of corporate success. The highest
level of metric is the key performance indicator (KPI), which is some objective
measurement of an aspect of a business that is critical to the success of that business.
KPIs can be collected together to provide a conceptual scorecard for a business
and can be associated with a number of different business activities, especially
within our four value driver areas such as financial value, productivity, risk, and trust.
In fact a large number of KPIs can be defined in terms of measuring performance
associated with many different BI analytical activities.
Another conceptual value of BI is the ability to capture the business definitions of
the key performance indicators, manage those definitions as part of the corporate
knowledge base, and then provide a visualization dashboard that reflects those KPI
measurements, presented in a form for management review. This BI dashboard
displays the results of the analytics required to configure the KPIs in a succinct visual
representation that can be understood instantaneously or selected for drill-down.
A BI dashboard will not only provide real-time presentation of the selected KPIs, but
will also hook directly into the BI components that allow for that drill-down.
By looking at some sample performance metrics, we can become comfortable
with engaging the business users to assess their query and reporting needs as well as
determine the degree to which existing data sets can address those needs. And the
categorization of business value drivers that has been presented earlier in this chapter
supports the BI process by helping to clarify general business objectives and corresponding performance metrics and indicators.
Improving the way the business is run as a result of integrating a BI framework
goes beyond the technologydkey stakeholders must specify what their perception of
‘‘performance’’ is, provide the performance measures, and then define achievable
targets and use the tools to inform the decision-making processes. These measures
are put in place to assess, measure, and control the degree to which the business
objectives are being met. Specific programs can be designed and developed around
improvements within any of these key categories. Consider these examples:
n Revenue generation via customer profiling and targeted marketing. Business
intelligence reports and analyses reflecting customer transactions and other interactions enable the development of individual customer profiles incorporating
demographic, psychographic, and behavioral data about each individual to
support customer community segmentation into a variety of clusters based on
different attributes and corresponding values. These categories form the basis
of sales and profitability measures by customer category, helping to increase sales
efforts and customer satisfaction.
n Risk management via identification of fraud, abuse, and leakage. Fraud, which
includes intentional acts of deception with knowledge that the action or representation could result in an inappropriate gain, is often perpetrated through the
exploitation of systemic scenarios. Fraud detection is a type of analysis that looks for
prevalent types of patterns that appear with some degree of frequency within certain
identified scenarios. Reporting of the ways that delivered products and services
match what had been sold to customers (within the contexts of their contracts/agreements) may highlight areas of revenue leakage. Both of these risks can be analyzed
and brought to the attention of the proper internal authorities for remediation.
n Improved customer satisfaction via profiling, personalization, and customer
lifetime value analysis. Customer lifetime value analysis calculates the measure
of a customer’s profitability over the lifetime of the relationship, incorporating
the costs associated with managing that relationship as well as the revenues
expected from that customer. Employing the results of customer profiling can
do more than just enhance that customer’s experience by customizing the presentation of material or content. Customer profiles can be directly integrated into all
customer interactions, especially at inbound call centers, where customer profiles
can improve a customer service representative’s ability to deal with the customer,
expedite problem resolution, and perhaps even increase product and service sales.
n Improved procurement and acquisition productivity through spend analysis.
Spend analysis incorporates the collection, standardization, and categorization of
product purchase and supplier data to select the most dependable vendors,
streamline the RFP and procurement process, reduce costs, improve the predictability of high-value supply chains, and improve supply-chain predictability and
efficiency.
Each of these examples can be viewed in both the operational and the strategic
business perspectives. The operational view provides insight into existing conditions
and performance comparing existing activities to expectations. From the strategic
perspective, we can evaluate the degree to which any potential measurements impact
future corporate value.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Performance metrics are objective measures used to evaluate the performance of a business or specific processes within an organization. They provide quantitative data and can be associated with every business process. These metrics can be aggregated into higher-level metrics known as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs are critical to the success of the business and are often tied to strategic goals and objectives. They help track progress, align efforts with organizational goals, and enable focused decision-making.

A BI framework plays a crucial role in capturing and managing the business definitions of KPIs. It allows for the visualization of KPI measurements through dashboards, providing a succinct visual representation that can be easily understood and drilled down into for further analysis. BI helps improve the way a business is run by specifying performance measures, defining achievable targets, and using the tools to inform decision-making processes.

There are various areas where BI can drive improvements in business performance. For example, revenue generation can be enhanced through customer profiling and targeted marketing, identifying fraud and leakage can be improved through fraud detection and monitoring product and service delivery, customer satisfaction can be enhanced through customer profiling, personalization, and analysis of customer lifetime value, and procurement and acquisition productivity can be improved through spend analysis.

These examples highlight how BI can impact both operational and strategic aspects of a business, providing insights into existing conditions and performance, as well as evaluating the potential impact on future corporate value. By leveraging performance metrics and KPIs within a BI framework, organizations can make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and drive overall business success.

There is a lot of value to incorporating the analysis of BI in the context of
locationdwhere your customers live, where they shop, what the closest warehouses
to your retail locations are, and so on. Geographic data is largely available, and
spatial analytics tools will provide creative visualization methods for extracting actionable knowledge from your data when it is enhanced with geographic data, as
we will see in the next chapter.
The informative power of integrated data sets is improved when demographic and
psychographic attributes are combined with geographic ones. Certainly, a large
source of geographic attribution data is the U.S. Census Bureau, which publishes the
results of each 10-year census. This data details all sorts of demographic information
about geographic regions as small as a census tract (on the order of a few thousand
people).
For example, consider the information displayed in Table 15.1, which is derived
from data from the 2010 U.S. Census. When presented with a customer record whose
address was located within census tract 7006.07, there is a high probability that the
individual owns their own home (89.8% of the homes are owner-occupied), is likely
to be carrying a mortgage (since only 13.1% of the homes are owned free and clear),
and the homeowner is likely to be white (41.5%) or Asian (42.5%). The more
information we have to enhance the customer record, the better position we are in to
make these inferences.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Incorporating geographic data into business intelligence (BI) analysis provides valuable insights. Spatial analytics tools offer creative visualization methods for extracting actionable knowledge from data enhanced with geographic information. Combining demographic, psychographic, and geographic attributes enhances the informative power of integrated data sets.

The U.S. Census Bureau is a significant source of geographic attribution data, providing detailed demographic information about small geographic regions such as census tracts. For instance, data from the 2010 U.S. Census reveals insights about homeownership, mortgage status, and ethnic composition within a specific census tract (e.g., 7006.07). Utilizing this information, it becomes possible to infer characteristics of individuals, such as high homeownership rates (89.8% owner-occupied homes) and predominant ethnic backgrounds (41.5% white, 42.5% Asian), based on their addresses.

By enriching customer records with additional information, organizations can make more accurate inferences and improve their decision-making processes. The integration of geographic data within BI analysis offers valuable opportunities for leveraging location-based insights.

summarize

Census data can be used for more than the kind of attribution just described. Enhancing
the census data itself with data from other sources can provide significant information
about the kinds of people who live within a specific area. For example, let’s enhance
our previous example and see what else we can learn about our customer.
n We know that 82.3% of the households are owner occupied. By integrating
average home sale prices over the last 5 years along with the average mortgage
interest rates for the same time period, we can determine the average monthly
mortgage payment a homeowner makes. Because mortgage brokers typically
lend money as a function of a set of ratios of monthly debt to monthly salary,
we can calculate an educated guess as to the average monthly salary of homeowners within the geographic area, which in turn can contribute to a geographic clustering profile.
n If our customer record contains a business or daytime telephone number, we can
locate where the customer works and then determine the distance between home
and work.
n By integrating this data with geographic data about transportation options between
the two locations, we can also infer how the customer travels to work. By enhancing
that with details of transportation schedules (which may also be available electronically), we can infer the length of time of the customer’s commute to work.
For the most part, similar people tend to aggregate in the same areas (e.g., rich
people live among other rich people); we can take advantage of this by purchasing
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Census data can be enhanced with additional data sources to gain significant insights into the characteristics of people living in a specific area. Beyond basic attribution, this enriched data can provide valuable information about customers. Here are some examples:

By integrating average home sale prices and mortgage interest rates, we can calculate the average monthly mortgage payment for homeowners in a specific area. This information can help estimate the average monthly salary of homeowners, contributing to a geographic clustering profile.

If a customer record includes a business or daytime telephone number, we can determine where the customer works and calculate the distance between their home and workplace.

By incorporating transportation data and schedules, we can infer how the customer commutes to work and estimate the length of their commute.

Since people with similar characteristics tend to reside in the same areas (e.g., affluent individuals living among other affluent people), organizations can take advantage of this knowledge by purchasing additional data sets to enhance their understanding of customer demographics and behavior. By leveraging these insights, businesses can make more informed decisions and tailor their strategies to specific customer segments.

summarize

Customer behavior is also a somewhat fuzzily defined term; for our purposes let’s
suggest that ‘‘customer behavior’’ models are intended to capture information about
the actions a customer performs under specific circumstances.
As an example, let’s say that a retail company emailed a special coupon for an instore purchase of a particular item. There are a number of specific circumstances
associated with this scenario: the presentation of the offer, the method of presentation, the time at which the offer was presented, the time the customer took an action,
the timeframe associated with the offer, a particular retail location. Given this
scenario, the retailer can track customer actions in relation to the circumstancesdthe
customer ignored the offer, or took advantage of it at some specific time and location.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Customer behavior refers to the actions that customers take in specific circumstances. For instance, a retail company may send a special coupon via email for an in-store purchase. The circumstances surrounding this scenario include how the offer is presented, the timing of the offer, the customer's response time, the timeframe of the offer, and the specific retail location. The retailer can track customer behavior to see if customers ignore the offer or take advantage of it at a particular time and location. Understanding customer behavior helps businesses analyze the effectiveness of their marketing strategies and tailor their approaches to better meet customer preferences and needs.
------------------
**You:**


summarize

In essence, the initial objective of capturing and analyzing customer behavior is to
develop models reflecting customer decision-making processes. In turn, these
models are expected to help predict behaviors associated with the different customer
archetypes. To continue the example, the company can link a tracking mechanism to
the email campaign such as a bar code to be scanned at the point of sale. After the
conclusion of the campaign, statistics can be collected about which customers
responded. That data set can then be subjected to dimensional analysis based on the
customer profile characteristics. This will allow some segmentation to suggest any
correlation between selected variables and purchasing the product, such as showing
predispositions like:
n Customers between the ages of 30 and 40
n Customers living within 2.5 miles of the retail location
n Customers with an income between $80,000 and $100,000 per year
n Customers who vacation in Florida during December
Remember, though, that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Identifying potentially dependent variables may suggest a predisposition, but establishing
the predictive nature of this suggestion requires additional research. The bottom line
is that there is a need feeding the insight back into the process, and you should ask
questions such as:
n Can the correlation be validated using additional campaigns?
Can you verify the causal nature of the correlation? Does this require some alternate investigation such as surveys or focus groups?
n Can the variable dependences be refined to better target the customer profiles?

The objective of capturing and analyzing customer behavior is to develop models that reflect customer decision-making processes and help predict behaviors associated with different customer archetypes. For example, a company can track customer responses to an email campaign by linking a tracking mechanism, such as a barcode, to be scanned at the point of sale. After the campaign, statistics are collected and subjected to dimensional analysis based on customer profile characteristics, allowing for segmentation and identification of correlations between variables and product purchases. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Validating correlations, establishing causality, and refining variable dependences require further research, such as additional campaigns, surveys, or focus groups. This ongoing process helps businesses gain insights and better target customer profiles.

summarize

If the first objective is to understand who the customers are and what they do, the next
objective is to apply what you believe about customer archetypes and behaviors to
influence changes in relation to customer behavior. There may be many approaches
to behavior change, and that effort can be directed inside the organization or outside
to the customer community.
As one approach, the analytical results of customer profile analysis might
highlight a gap in a business process in which the intended target customer audience
is not being reached. In that case, the process can be adjusted to broaden the reach to
the targeted customer types. An example is determining that a particular age segment
is not responding as expected, and altering the marketing and advertising plan to
insert television advertisements on channels or networks with the desired age-group
audience.
In another approach, you might see that one specific customer segment is predisposed to taking some action. In this case, you might determine if there are other
customers who might be easily moved from one segment to the desired one through
a sequence of engagement. An example is an airline seeking to engage more business
travelers by offering ‘‘elite status’’ incentives for purchasing air travel. At some
point, travelers with improved elite statuses will have ratcheted into the desired
customer segment.
There can be some variety in the approaches to influencing change, some of
which are hybrids of changing both internal processes and external characteristics.
The common thread, though, is that analyzing customer profiles and behavior will
prove to be a meaningless task unless actions are taken in reaction to what is learned.

The next objective after understanding customer archetypes and behaviors is to apply this knowledge to influence changes in customer behavior. There are various approaches to behavior change, which can be directed internally within the organization or externally to the customer community.

One approach is to adjust business processes based on the insights gained from customer profile analysis. If a targeted customer audience is not being reached, the processes can be modified to broaden the reach to those specific customer types. For example, if a certain age segment is not responding as expected, the marketing and advertising plan can be adjusted to include television advertisements on channels or networks that cater to that age group.

Another approach involves identifying specific customer segments that are predisposed to taking certain actions. In this case, efforts can be made to move other customers from one segment to the desired one through a sequence of engagement. For instance, an airline may offer incentives for purchasing air travel to engage more business travelers and elevate them to "elite status," eventually transitioning them into the desired customer segment.

Different approaches may involve a combination of changing internal processes and external characteristics. However, the key point is that analyzing customer profiles and behavior is meaningless unless actions are taken in response to the insights gained. Implementation and adaptation are essential to effectively influence customer behavior.

At the most basic level, customer lifetime value (CLV) is a theoretical financial value
of a customer over the duration of the relationship with your business. There are
many theories on how this value is calculated. For example, one approach is that
CLV is calculated as the net present value of the average predicted profit expected
from sales to (or cash flow attributed to) any customer.
From a practical perspective, the concept of customer lifetime value is appealing
because it not only provides a tangible value to be associated with customer
acquisition, it also directs the key stakeholders in the company to take a long-term

view associated with managing and maintaining the customer relationship. There are
many models for calculating customer lifetime value that incorporate many different
variables, although many models incorporate key concepts such as:

**ChatGPT:**


Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the theoretical financial value that represents the total worth of a customer to a business throughout their entire relationship. There are various approaches to calculating CLV, with one common method being the net present value of the average predicted profit or cash flow attributed to a customer.

From a practical standpoint, CLV is valuable because it not only assigns a tangible value to customer acquisition but also encourages businesses to adopt a long-term perspective when managing and maintaining customer relationships. Numerous models exist for calculating CLV, and these models often incorporate different variables. However, some key concepts commonly considered in CLV calculations include:

Average predicted profit or cash flow: The expected revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime.
Customer retention rate: The likelihood that a customer will continue their relationship with the business over time.
Cost of customer acquisition: The expenses incurred to acquire a new customer.
Discount rate: The rate used to adjust future cash flows to their present value.
Customer churn rate: The rate at which customers discontinue their relationship with the business.

By understanding and calculating CLV, businesses can make informed decisions regarding customer acquisition, retention strategies, and resource allocation to maximize the long-term value of their customer base.
------------------

summarize in easy manner so that i can understand with in few lines

A customer’s lifetime value is then a function of the net present value of the
revenue per customer over the customer’s lifetime minus the acquisition, retention,
and servicing costs. There may be other variables as well, such as attrition costs
(incurred when a customer severs his or her relationship), as well as revenues (such
as penalties a customer must pay for severing contracts early).
The customer lifetime value concept can also provide guidance into strategies for
dealing with different kinds of customers. One example involves understanding the
value proposition for customer acquisition. There is typically a cost associated with
acquiring new customers. If that cost is greater than the customer lifetime value,
there would have to be some motive other than profitability that drives customer
acquisition!
A different example relies on more comprehensive customer segmentation. This
allows you to be more precise when differentiating between the average customer
lifetime value across the entire customer base and analyzing customer lifetime value
within discrete customer segments in ways that may influence marketing and sales.
For example, a company’s overall average customer lifetime value may be $25, but if
the customer lifetime value of males between the ages of 18 and 34 is $50, then we
might draw the conclusion that the product base skews younger. In this case, it may
make sense to orient the marketing budget toward individuals meeting that specific
demographic profile because the return on investment is much greater.
Deriving Insight from Collections of Data 241
One more use is examining processes within the organization that can be adjusted
to help increase customer lifetime value. This can be done by focusing on optimizing
the dependent variables, such as lowering the associated costs, increasing customer
lifetime, or increasing the profitability.
Yet one big challenge for calculating and managing customer lifetime value is
accumulating the right data needed for each of the dependent variables. As an
example, let’s look at one of these variables: duration of the customer lifetime.
Calculating customer lifetime requires historical data detailing all customer transactions across all areas of the business. You cannot just depend on the dates of the
sales transactions, especially when the sales cycle requires numerous steps each time
the customer is engaged. At the same time, there may be other customer touch points
that indicate engagement (such as calls to the call center), while monitoring of
service usage could signal a reduction in use, signifying an imminent disengagement.
In each case, coming up with a definition for customer engagement and determining what data is necessary to confirm that a customer continues to be engaged
requires both defined policies and directed data management effort. The same can be
said about any of the other variables: what are the actual costs of acquisition? Does
that include the costs of manufacturing the product, marketing, general administrative costs allocated to each customer? What are the ongoing servicing costs? Do
those include specific service and maintenance activities for each customer, or do we
also allocate part of the infrastructure charges (such as placing a new cell tower) to
service costs?
Customer lifetime value is a very powerful concept that can help drive specific
actions, both strategic and tactical. And the need to present the appropriate collections of data to help analysts formulate the right types of questions lends credibility
with our recurring themes of clarifying business term definitions, understanding
business user requirements, and ensuring quality and governance for the source data
sets used for driving the data discovery and analysis
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the total value a customer brings to a business over their entire relationship. It is calculated by subtracting acquisition, retention, and servicing costs from the revenue generated by the customer. CLV helps businesses understand the profitability of acquiring new customers and allows for targeted marketing based on different customer segments. Improving CLV involves optimizing costs, increasing customer lifetime, and boosting profitability. However, calculating CLV requires accurate and comprehensive data on customer transactions and engagement. Proper data management and clear definitions are essential for accurate CLV calculations. CLV is a valuable concept that guides strategic and tactical decision-making by providing insights into customer value and driving actions for business growth.

summarize

A table key is a set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify any individual
record within the table. For example, people databases might use a Social Security
number as a key (although this is ill-advised, considering that many people do not
have a Social Security number), because (presumably) no two people share the same
one. If we have one table that contains a specified key field, other tables may be
structured with references to the first table’s key as a way of connecting pairs of
records drawn from both tables. When one table’s key is used as a reference to
another table, that key is called a foreign key.
Modern relational databases enforce a constraint known as referential integrity,
which states that if an attribute’s value is used in table A as a foreign key to table B,
then that key value must exist in one record in table B. There are two aspects to
profiling key relationships: identifying that a key relationship exists, and identifying
what are called orphans in a violated referential integrity situation.
A foreign key relationship exists between (table A, column x) and (table B,
column y) if all the values in (table A, column x) overlap completely with the values
in (table B, column y) and the values in (table B, column y) are unique. A data
profiling application should be able to apply this assertion algorithmically to find
foreign key relationships.
Orphans are foreign key values that do not appear in records in the targeted table.
An example might be a reference in a catalog to a product that is no longer being
made or sold by the company. The referential integrity constraint asserts that if the
product is referenced in the catalog, it must exist in the active products database. If
the data profiling tool is told that a foreign key relationship exists, it is simple to
check for orphans. Even if the profiling tool has no prior knowledge about foreign
Data Profiling 145
keys, it is possible to loosen the rules for identifying the foreign key relationship to
find near-foreign keys where there are some values that would be orphans if the
relationship did really exist. As in other cases, the tool can only propose these
discoveries as rules, and it is up to the analyst to determine the value in the proposal.
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


A table key is a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It can be used to connect records between different tables through foreign key relationships. Referential integrity ensures that if a foreign key is used in one table, it must exist as a primary key in another table. Data profiling involves identifying key relationships and detecting orphans, which are foreign key values that do not have corresponding records in the referenced table. Profiling tools can algorithmically identify foreign key relationships and check for orphans. Even without prior knowledge of foreign keys, the tool can propose potential relationships and orphans based on data patterns, but the final assessment is left to the analyst.

**ChatGPT:**


Data quality refers to the overall reliability, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and relevancy of data. It measures the fitness of data for its intended use and ensures that data is reliable, trustworthy, and suitable for analysis and decision-making. Good data quality is essential for businesses to make informed decisions, identify trends, detect anomalies, and derive meaningful insights from their data. Poor data quality, on the other hand, can lead to incorrect conclusions, flawed analysis, and ineffective decision-making. Data quality can be affected by various factors, such as data entry errors, duplication, inconsistency, outdated information, missing values, and lack of data validation processes. Maintaining high data quality requires implementing data quality controls, data cleansing and validation techniques, data governance practices, and regular monitoring and maintenance of data to ensure its accuracy and integrity.

**ChatGPT:**


Data profiling is the process of analyzing and assessing the content, structure, and quality of data within a dataset or database. It involves examining the data to gain insights into its characteristics, identifying patterns, anomalies, and relationships, and understanding its overall quality and suitability for specific purposes.

Data profiling helps organizations understand their data assets and make informed decisions regarding data management, data integration, data migration, and data quality improvement. It involves examining various aspects of the data, such as data types, data distributions, data patterns, data completeness, data uniqueness, data dependencies, and data relationships.

During data profiling, techniques like statistical analysis, data visualization, and data exploration are employed to uncover insights about the data. It helps identify data quality issues, such as missing values, inconsistent formats, outliers, duplicate records, and referential integrity problems. By profiling the data, organizations can gain a better understanding of the data's characteristics and assess its reliability, accuracy, and overall quality.

Data profiling plays a crucial role in data governance, data integration, and data quality management initiatives. It provides a foundation for data cleansing, data transformation, and data enrichment activities. The insights gained from data profiling enable organizations to take proactive measures to improve data quality, ensure compliance with regulations, and enhance the effectiveness of data-driven decision-making processes.

Services and System Evolution
It is probable that the expertise required to assemble and run the BI program is not
available within your organization. It is also probable that many stages of building
the BI infrastructure require expertise no longer needed once the system has been
put into production. For these and assorted other reasons, it is probable that you
will need to augment your staff with external service providers to help move the
BI program along. In this section we look at some of the services external
suppliers can provide.
The Business Intelligence Environment 73
ARCHITECTURE AND INTEGRATION
When assembling a data warehouse and BI architecture, it may be beneficial to bring
in consultants who have worked on previous successful BI projects to help architect
the overall solution. Frequently the concept of ‘‘not invented here’’ (NIH) cannot
only slow down the construction of the environment but also lead to its demise.
Remember that the ultimate client is the business partner and that making that
business partner satisfied with the program is the ultimate project goal. If that means
hiring external consultants to help make it happenddo it!
In terms of data integration services, the numerous data integration and ETL
software providers are likely to have supplied software to many similar organizations
building similar systems. They may also offer consultative help in assembling the
data integration process and making sure that it works.
At the end of the spectrum are service providers willing to import your data and
your integration parameters, perform the integration, and then return the reformatted
data to you. This may be a viable option when the provider has numerous tools and
hardware at its disposal, for which you can eliminate your company’s capital
investment requirements.
DATA GOVERNANCE
Most transactional or operational business applications use data as a means to
accomplish immediate needs, but as more data sets are funneled into a data warehouse and are repurposed for analysis, the needs and expectations for quality,
availability, and accessibility change dramatically. However, those in control of the
origination of these data sets may not be aware of the importance of observing the
collected requirements of all downstream consumers.
In order to ensure that all data needs are met, a data governance program can be
instituted to help oversee all aspects of the data life cycle. Creating an organization of
data governors and data stewards helps to ensure that data policies are defined,
proposed, agreed to, disseminated, and enforced. This helps in aligning expectations
across the enterprise, reducing inconsistency, and eliminating costly reconciliations
and recalculations. Often organizations will engage external expertise in defining
and guiding the deployment of a data governance program.
MIGRATION
Some organizations are interested in instituting a BI program, but their data
resources are not in a state that can be properly integrated into a BI environment,
either because their environment is in disarray or because their information is
embedded in proprietary legacy systems from which it is hard to extract. As
74 Business Intelligence
a preface to building a BI program, and in conjunction with a business process
improvement program, it is useful to migrate older systems into more modern
systems that are more amenable to data extraction and manipulation. Because this
system or data migration is a one-time deal, bringing in a service provider to assist in
the migration process is a reasonable choice.
ANALYTICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
If the cost of building the infrastructure is too much for your organization, though
you still want to exploit a BI environment, then the answer might be an analytical
service provider. This is a company that can provide any or all the components of the
BI process, ranging from data cleansing and integration services all the way to
completely hosted data warehouse and analytical  solutions.
TRAINING
There are organizations dedicated to providing training and education in the BI and
data warehousing areas. It is worthwhile to make sure that your staff members are
properly trained and that the organizations doing the training are recognized as
providing the best knowledge when it comes to the techniques, design, and strategies
to build successful BI programs. Training should focus on all aspects of the BI
program, including data warehouse architecture, data integration, data marts, operational data stores, as well as the tools that are used, such as data extraction and
transformation, OLAP systems, and front-end data consumer analysis tools.
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
Last, sometimes neither the technical staff nor the business clients are completely
aware of the capabilities that exist within the marketplace for providing business
analytics. Again, it may be beneficial to engage external consultants familiar with
your industry and with the analytical applications that have been built to support your
industry

Services and System Evolution:

Architecture and Integration:

Bringing in external consultants who have experience with successful business intelligence (BI) projects can be beneficial in architecting the overall BI solution. Overcoming the "not invented here" mentality and focusing on satisfying business partners' needs is crucial.
Data integration services provided by software vendors can assist in assembling and ensuring the effectiveness of the data integration process within the BI architecture. Some service providers can handle the entire data integration process, eliminating the need for significant capital investment.

Data Governance:

Implementing a data governance program helps ensure that data quality, availability, and accessibility meet the changing needs of analysis in a BI environment. External expertise may be engaged to define and guide the deployment of a data governance program, aligning expectations and reducing inconsistencies.

Migration:

Organizations with data resources in disarray or embedded in legacy systems may need to migrate their systems to more modern environments suitable for integration into a BI program. Engaging a service provider to assist in the migration process can be a reasonable choice.

Analytical Service Providers:

If building a BI infrastructure is cost-prohibitive, organizations can consider partnering with analytical service providers. These providers offer various components of the BI process, including data cleansing, integration services, and fully hosted data warehouses and analytics solutions.

Training:

Dedicated training organizations can provide comprehensive training and education in BI and data warehousing. Ensuring proper training for staff members in various aspects of the BI program, including architecture, data integration, and analysis tools, is crucial for success.

Information Processing and Information Flow
The critical dependencies between successful business processes and the use of
information effectively demonstrate the need to understand how information flows
through processes and how information is used to support those processes. Mapping
data lineage across the process will shed light on where decision steps can be
improved by actionable knowledge. In this section we look at a number of different
kinds of processing paradigms and how they reflect the application’s implementation
of the business activities.
TRANSACTION PROCESSING
Operations in a transaction processing system are interactions between a user and
a computer system where there is the perception of an immediate response from the
system to the user’s requests. A commonly encountered example of transaction
processing is the use of an automated teller machine (ATM), as shown in Figure 6.1.
Although there is an appearance of a monolithic system that responds to user
requests, behind the scenes each interaction may involve a large number of interdependent systems. The concept of a transaction actually incorporates this reality: A
transaction is really a set of operations grouped together as a unit of work, where no
Business Processes and Information Flow 81
individual operation takes its long-term effect unless all the operations can take effect.
So, using the ATM example, before the bank allows the ATM to disburse cash, the
user’s account balance must be queried to see if there are sufficient funds, the ATM
must be checked to see if it has enough cash to satisfy the request, the user’s account
must then be debited, and the cash can be disbursed. Yet if the result of any of these
subsidiary operations indicates that servicing the request is infeasible, all the operations must be rolled backdyou wouldn’t want the bank to debit your account without
giving you the cash, nor would the bank want the cash to be disbursed without debiting
your account. In this case the information flow follows the thread of control as it passes
through the individual interaction associated with each transaction.
OPERATIONAL PROCESSING
We will use the term operational processing to refer to a system that makes use of
computers to control a process. These controlled processes can be related to automated activities or might even be used to guide workflows such as opening a bank
account, picking and packaging materials for shipment, or performing diagnostic
tests for your car.

82 Business Intelligence
As an example, an automated manufacturing line may have multiple machine
components, each requiring system control instructions based on its internal operational requirements as well as depending on information inputs from other interconnected machine components within the entire system. For example, a potato chip
manufacturing process contains a series of machines, such as a washer, a slicer,
a fryer, a sorter, a flavor enhancer, and a packaging machine, each of which helps
transform a potato into a collection of potato chips.
In this example, there is a lot of information required at multiple processing
locations throughout the system to guarantee continuous, managed control of the
system. Data about the individual interactions between sequential stages as well as
systemic data need to be propagated to multiple controllers. To continue our potato
chip factory example, each processing stage requires information about the flow of
(unfinished) product from the previous stages. In addition, certain events will trigger
auxiliary control operations (e.g., the seasoning hopper volume falls below the
required amount, triggering an alert and a pause in the assembly line). And global
events can also trigger actions (e.g., the cooking temperature exceeds a safe limit,
triggering a complete line shutdown).
Operational process information flows are likely to connect heavy sequential
operational processing augmented by lightweight interconnections for sharing
information.
BATCH PROCESSING
In contrast with transaction processing, batch processing takes collections of
sequences of similar operations that are to be executed in batches (hence the
name). Although both transaction processing and batch processing execute
a series of operations, batch processing differs from transaction processing in
terms of information flow in the granularity of application of each processing
stage. A batch processing application is more likely to apply each processing
stage to a set of data instances as a whole and then push the result to the next
processing stage.
As an example, a company might accumulate transaction-based sales orders
during the day but process those orders and prepare order fulfillment as a batch
process at night. The fulfillment processing aggregates order line items by customer,
determines packaging requirements, generates pick lists that instruct the warehouse
workers what items are to be selected for each shipment, generates shipping labels
with appropriate shipping vendor data, updates inventory totals, and generates orders
to restock inventory, among other operations.
Batch processing information flows typically convey heavy data payloads
between multiple processing stages, each of which performs a single component of
the overall unit of work for the data collection.
Business Processes and Information Flow 83
ANALYTICAL PROCESSING
Analytical processing involves the interaction between analysts and collections of
aggregated data that may have been reformulated into alternate representational
forms as a means for improved analytical performance. In this case, the information
flow model most likely will take on two aspects: the flow of information into the
analytical processing environment from its suppliers and the flow of information
from the analytical processing system to its users. The first flow is likely to be more
of an operational flow, in which data sets may be extracted and moved in large
chunks to a staging area where those data sets move through different processing
stages. And despite the BI aspect of the users’ interactions, the information flow
between the data mart clients may resemble a transactional information flow, with
multiple analysts executing sequences of queries, although here they are less likely to
be true transactions
------------------
**ChatGPT:**


Information Processing and Information Flow:

Transaction Processing:

Transaction processing involves user-computer interactions that provide immediate responses. Transactions are sets of operations grouped as a unit of work, where all operations must be successful for the transaction to take effect. Information flows follow the thread of control through each transaction's individual interactions.

Operational Processing:

Operational processing refers to using computers to control processes, such as automated activities or workflows. Information flows in operational processing systems involve data propagation among interconnected components, ensuring continuous control and information sharing for managing the system effectively.

Batch Processing:

Batch processing executes similar operations on data instances as a whole in batches. It involves processing collections of data, such as aggregating sales orders during the day and fulfilling them as a batch process at night. Information flows in batch processing include heavy data payloads between processing stages, where each stage performs a component of the overall unit of work.

Analytical Processing:

Analytical processing involves analysts interacting with aggregated data in alternative forms to improve analytical performance. Information flows in analytical processing include the flow of data into the processing environment from suppliers and the flow of information from the processing system to users. It combines operational flows, such as data extraction and staging, with transactional flows as analysts execute sequences of queries.

Understanding the different processing paradigms and their associated information flows is crucial for optimizing business activities and improving decision-making within an organization.

Analytical Information Needs and Information Flows
A good way to motivate the discussion of business process mapping and information
flows is looking at a specific example, such as analyzing customer activities for the
purposes of creating customer profiles. Let’s say you have been tasked with building
a data mart for the purpose of analyzing a customer value portfolio based on all
customer interactions, ranging from telephone inquiries to purchases, returns,
customer service calls, payment history, and so on. This implies a number of
information needs.
78 Business Intelligence
First, you must determine what information will be required to do this analysis, and then determine where the data sets will be sourced, as well as how the
information is to be extracted, transformed in preparation for integration into the
analytical platform, and how that information is to be organized for analysis.
Next, you must be able to consider rapid methods for integrating new data sets
when it is determined that they are to be included in the analytical environment.
Alternatively, you must be able to manage the provision of results (whether that is
simple reports or more complex presentation of actionable knowledge) to the
business analysts, each of which may be logically or physically situated in
a different location.
It would be difficult, if not impossible, to build an analytical system without
having a clear understanding of which data sets are potential inputs, what internal
models are to be used for representation, where the data sets come from, how
those data sets need to be manipulated before they can be imported into a data
warehouse, what information is to be provisioned through different subject or
content data marts, and what kinds of applications are using that data. More
importantly, after the system is built it is critical to have a blueprint of the way
that information flows into and out of the system to provide a tracking mechanism
to back up any conclusions that are drawn through data analysis. To get a handle
on how to manage this environment, it would be useful to have a high-level
model of the processes associated with populating and using an analytical
environment.
THE VALUE OF MODELING INFORMATION FLOW
Even when considering the creation of an analytical environment, there is value in
understanding the ins and outs of the transactional and operational business
processes and their corresponding application and information flows. The results
of a BI activity are not limited to a company’s interaction with customers; those
analyses can generate actionable knowledge as a result of manipulating data sets
accumulated from a large collection of data producers, such as internal (i.e., within
the organization) and external (i.e., cross-company) business applications. As an
example, consider a supply-chain interaction between your company and
a collection of product suppliers. There is embedded business knowledge that can
be derived from examining all details of those interactions, including measuring
vendor sensitivity to your requests, response time, methods of delivery, compliance
with contractual agreements, and conformance to just-in-time delivery issues. To
extract this intelligence we must understand how we have implemented our
business applications and determine what data we need to collect and where that
information needs to be collected. The information flow model will assist in this
determination.
Business Processes and Information Flow 79
PROCESS DESIGN VERSUS APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION
Traditionally, implementers are trained in algorithm design to break down each
application into a collection of discrete processing stages that can be essentially
implemented in isolation. When all the stages are finished, they are combined to
form the complete application. But this process of discretizing the construction of
applications leads to an assembly line model of information processing in the way
that data and partial results are forwarded from one processing stage to another.
These processes take data (e.g., a transaction stream or extracted records from
multiple data sets) as input and provide some product as output. That can be
a physical product (such as invoices to be sent out to customers), a side effect (such
as the settlement of a sequence of transactions), or an information product (such as
a BI report).
To remedy the eventual effects of this development process, an important part of
the methodology of designing and implementing a business application is modeling
the business process as a way of guiding the algorithmic implementation. In fact,
building this model is the first step in the process of exploiting information. This
business process modeling incorporates descriptions of the business objects that
interact within the system as well as the interactions between users and those
business objects. The same concept holds true for analytical and intelligence
applications, where the eventual product is described in terms of analytical use and
benefit.

Analytical Information Needs and Information Flows:

Determining Information Requirements:

When analyzing customer activities to create customer profiles, it is essential to determine the necessary information for the analysis and identify data sources. This includes understanding how data will be extracted, transformed, and integrated into the analytical platform and organizing the information for analysis.

Managing New Data Sets:

The ability to rapidly integrate new data sets into the analytical environment is crucial. The process should accommodate the inclusion of new data and ensure seamless integration into the existing system.

Provisioning Results to Business Analysts:

The results of the analysis, whether in the form of reports or actionable insights, need to be provided to business analysts. This process should consider the distribution of results to analysts located in different locations.

The Value of Modeling Information Flow:

Broad Scope of Business Intelligence:

Business intelligence activities go beyond customer interactions and involve analyzing data from various sources. Understanding transactional and operational processes and their associated information flows allows for the generation of actionable knowledge from a diverse range of data producers.

Extracting Business Intelligence:

Examining details of supply-chain interactions, such as vendor responsiveness, delivery methods, and compliance, can provide valuable business intelligence. Modeling information flow helps determine the necessary data to collect and where to collect it from.

Process Design versus Application Implementation:

Business Process Modeling:

Designing and implementing business applications should involve modeling the business process itself. This approach guides the algorithmic implementation and ensures that the information flow aligns with the desired business objectives.

Incorporating Business Objects and Interactions:

Business process modeling includes descriptions of the business objects involved in the system and the interactions between users and those objects. This approach applies to both operational and analytical applications, where the focus is on describing the analytical use and benefits of the eventual product.

Performance monitoring and improvement both rely on measuring and reporting the
scores for metrics used to quantify the effectiveness of particular processes and the
value of their outcomes. Although metrics scores are used in different ways based on
the business processes being monitored, there are certain characteristics that are
common to the concept of a metric. At the most basic level, a metric represents
a quantification of a single score to answer a specific business question, and the base
level metric, in many cases, can be a simple aggregate value such as a count or an
average. In turn, individual metrics can be grouped together into higher-level scores
computed as functions of the individual component measurements.
Every metric is intended to contribute in answering business questions. A
prerequisite to defining data warehouse models or building a reporting system is
engaging the business users to help in identifying, clarifying, and documenting
specific business data needs for the system. This requires interviewing key system
stakeholders and customers to clarify business processes and needs as a prelude to
synthesizing the requirements for the system model. This incorporates reviewing,
analyzing, and integrating system information and stakeholder interview data to
create key artifacts such as a fact/qualifier matrix that will drive the definition of the
model, the determination of data sources to populate the model, and the processes for
presenting metric information back to the business users.

THE FACT/QUALIFIER MATRIX
Without loss of generalization, let’s initially consider the base level metric and
enumerate key attributes that are relevant for capturing the performance
measures critical for answering the business questions in a fact/qualifier matrix.
A fact/qualifier matrix is a standard data warehouse development tool designed to
organize specific business information needs into a format that aids in developing
relational and multidimensional data structures. Facts represent specific business
questions or discrete items of information that are tracked or managed, and are
generally items that can be counted or measured such as quantity or volume.
Qualifiers represent conditions or dimensions that are used to filter or organize your
facts. Qualifiers include items such as time or geographic area.
In a fact/qualifier matrix, all business facts are listed down the left-hand column
and all possible qualifier dimensions are listed across the columns. An entry at any
intersection identifies the qualifying dimensions used to filter, organize, or aggregate
the associated fact data.
As an example, business questions like ‘‘How many widgets have been shipped
by size by warehouse each week by color?’’ and ‘‘What are the total sales for widgets
by size each week for each salesperson by region?’’ provide insight into the progress
of a metadata registration process as part of a performance management activity.
The fact/qualifier matrix will specify the business facts that are expected to be
measureddin this case, ‘‘the number of widgets shipped’’ and ‘‘total sales of
widgets shipped,’’ and the specific dimensional qualifiers are ‘‘size,’’ ‘‘color,’’
‘‘week,’’ ‘‘warehouse,’’ ‘‘salesperson,’’ and ‘‘region’’ (Table 7.2). Subsequent
iterations of the analysis process may derive greater precision for some of these

Warehouse X
Color X
Week X X
Salesperson X
Region X
94 Business Intelligence
qualifiers, such as breaking out the week qualifier into time frames with different
levels of granularity (such as daily, hourly, yearly, etc.).
Documentation for the facts and their qualifiers may already exist, but restructuring those requirements within a fact/qualifier matrix provides some benefits:
n It provides a logical structure for capturing business user requirements.
n It provides a standardized way to present the requirements back to the business
users for validation.
n It enables the analyst to review the collected business requirements and determine
if there are any overlapping facts or common dimensional qualifiers.
n It guides the analysts in identifying the data sources that can be used to populate
the metrics data model.
THE METRICS MODEL
The fact/qualifier matrix provides guidance for developing how the metrics are used,
combined, or rolled up to provide summarization and drill-through. For example,
each presented score can either be a base metric score, consisting of a single quantification of a requested qualified fact, or a qualified score computed as a function of
the weighted scores associated with other metrics. These scores are often accompanied by other relevant metadata such as units of measure, classification, and evaluation criteria (or thresholds) for reporting satisfaction of business user expectations.
To continue our example, the business user might be interested in more than just
knowing the number of widgets shipped. Instead, that manager might want to ensure
that each warehouse is shipping a minimum level of 20 units of each size and color of
widget every week, and anticipating shipping more than 30 units of each size of widget
each week. In this case, the metric is the count (broken out along the defined dimensions), and the evaluation criteria might be specified in terms of a three-tiered scoring:
n Green if the number is greater than or equal to 30;
n Yellow if the number is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 30; and
n Red if the number is less than 20.
Metrics defined at a higher aggregate level will compose the results of the
incorporated metric scores. In our example, the cumulative score for all the warehouses for each widget size shipped is the sum of the number of widget units shipped
for each size, divided by the number of warehouses. In other words, the cumulative
average reflects the higher level of performance, and we can use the same thresholds
for scoring as at the lower level.
Since metrics and scores associated with compound metrics are to be reported to
the end-client, the designer must enable the definition of ‘‘buckets’’ or categories for
the alignment of metric scores into the right collection. For example, we might group
Data Requirements Analysis 95
the logistics performance metrics together into one category, product-oriented
performance metrics (such as color and size) into another category, and the sales
metrics into another. This effectively defines a taxonomy structure for metrics.
However, we must be aware that some metrics may be suitable to support more than
one hierarchy, so the model’s means for categorization must not restrict the inclusion
of a metric into a single logical bucket.
The metrics model must be able to support the capture of both the base-level
metrics (pure counts) and the more complex compound metrics composed of lower
levels. This suggests a model that supports a hierarchy that captures the parent-child
relationship as well as the categories associated with the eventual reporting scheme.
Doing so enables the end-client to review the top-level report, but also enables the
drill-through capability that allows the analyst to seek out root causes exposed
through the reporting. As long as the model captures the score for each metric as well
as the evaluation criteria within each hierarchy, the analyst can drill down through the
hierarchy levels to determine where the specific measures indicate an opportunity for
operational improvement or for instituting alternate policies to improve performance.

Performance Monitoring and Improvement:

Characteristics of Metrics:

Metrics are used to measure and report the effectiveness of processes and the value of their outcomes. They represent quantifications of specific scores that answer business questions. Base-level metrics can be simple aggregates like counts or averages, while higher-level scores are computed functions of individual metrics.

Engaging Business Users:

Before defining data warehouse models or building a reporting system, it is crucial to involve business users in identifying and documenting specific data needs. This requires interviewing stakeholders and customers to clarify business processes, synthesize requirements, and create artifacts like a fact/qualifier matrix to drive the system model.

The Fact/Qualifier Matrix:

Organizing Performance Measures:
The fact/qualifier matrix is a tool used in data warehouse development to organize business information needs. Facts represent specific business questions or items that can be measured, while qualifiers are conditions or dimensions used to filter or organize the facts. The matrix helps capture requirements, present them to users for validation, identify overlapping facts or common qualifiers, and guide data source identification.

The Metrics Model:

Using Metrics and Scores:

The fact/qualifier matrix guides the development of how metrics are used, combined, and rolled up for summarization and drill-through. Metrics can be base-level scores or computed scores based on other metrics. Evaluation criteria, thresholds, units of measure, and classifications are relevant metadata accompanying the scores.

Compound Metrics and Categorization:

Compound metrics composed of lower-level metrics can be categorized into buckets or categories for reporting alignment. The metrics model should support a hierarchy that captures parent-child relationships and categories, allowing for top-level reporting and drill-through analysis.

Enabling Performance Analysis:

The metrics model should capture scores and evaluation criteria within each hierarchy, enabling drill-down analysis to identify opportunities for operational improvement and alternative policies to enhance performance. The model facilitates reviewing top-level reports while exploring root causes through drill-through capabilities.

summarize with side headinfsInitial Steps in Starting a Business Intelligence Program
Technicians are drawn to large-scale data-intensive projects because of the technical
challenge as well as the alluring draw of ‘‘cool technology’’ or the opportunity to
learn new skills and enhance a resume. Business people are attracted by the belief
that a BI program will magically increase profitability while drastically decreasing
costs. Business people are incessantly pitched the silver bullet that is going to solve
all their past, current, and future business problems.
While either of these drivers may have been enough in the past to guarantee a BI
budget, the poor track record of these kinds of projects coupled with increasingly
focused project management and governance has forced the reduction in budget,
resources, and in the worst case the ultimate elimination of BI programs. It is
extremely important to understand some key success factors that will help maintain
corporate investment in BI. In the next sections we will drill down into fundamental
aspects of the BI program such as:
n Championship. Senior-level champions ensuring corporate sponsorship;
n Level-Setting. Establishing high-level goals and setting expectations;
n Partnering. Creating a partnership among the participants that provides incentives to act strategically;
n Vision. Asserting a strategic vision that guides design, development, and
deployment;
n Plan. Establishing a plan that delivers intermediate value while achieving the
long-term goals.
CHAMPIONSHIP AND MANAGEMENT SPONSORSHIP
There is no doubt that after reading any article, white paper, blog posting, or book on
data warehousing, BI, business analytics, master data management, or customer
relationship management (CRM), we might think that no single technological
advance could ever have taken place without the backing of a senior business
manager. And in spite of the concept being a cliche´, when we consider the intricacies
of integrating an analytical, strategic program into an operational environment, the
roadblocks that appear are not technical but mostly personal and political, necessitating a strong personality to champion the cause within the organization.
Reading between the lines in the literature, what we can infer is that one of the
reasons most frequently cited for the failure of a BI program is the lack of seniorlevel sponsorship. But what is meant by senior-level sponsorship? This term alludes
to two different concepts: explicitly, it is indicative of the seniority of the manager(s)
involved, but perhaps more importantly, it implicitly refers to ensuring a corporate
financial partnership for the program.
Planning for Success 37
The first concept focuses on establishing a partnership with a senior-level
manager (or, better yet, managers) at a level high enough to impose governance on
the program and one who is able to enforce cooperation with those entrusted with the
implementation of the program. This includes defining and ensuring the organizational commitment along and across the organization structure and removing barriers
to success.
The second concept focuses on the senior management’s establishing a vested
stake in the success of the project. Whether this involves direct profit and loss (P&L)
responsibility or whether it is defined more loosely in terms of stated business
expectations, having a senior manager with a personal stake in the success (and
correspondingly, the prevention of failure) of the program will project a corporate
commitment to project accountability. Even more important is the financial backing
(in other words: budget) needed to design, acquire the componentry for, build, and
deploy the necessary infrastructure as well as engage the right team with the
necessary skills. Also, attributing successes in the BI program to those managers
with a stake provides an additional personal incentive to make sure the project
succeeds.
ESTABLISHING HIGH-LEVEL GOALS AND SETTING EXPECTATIONS
When program failure is manifested as ‘‘missed expectations,’’ it often implies
a misalignment between the developers’ goals and the end users’ expectations. In
essence, user expectations must be set in the context of the value drivers for BI, the
ability of the technologists to develop tools to meet those expectations, and the
collective business users’ appetites for change. Any misalignment will lead to an
absence of well-defined goals, and in the absence of well-defined goals, how can we
ever determine the point of success of a project?
One of the most frequent critiques of the BI industry is the general expectation
that ‘‘if you build it, they will come.’’ In other words, build the data warehouse and
suddenly business clients will line up to drink from an unlimited tap of business
value. But if there are no goals for achieving value, the value drivers are not refined,
or if there are no measures or methods of measurement of success, what often
happens is that the time to build the data warehouse exceeds the patience level of the
business partners. By the time the data warehouse is completed, there is either
significant difficulty in extracting the right kinds of reports from it or limited trust in
the information that is extracted from it.
To properly recognize success, we must have proper metrics used to measure
success. This has to be defined in terms of delivering the value that the client expects.
This means that there has to be a well-defined approach to soliciting business user
needs, expectations, and performance measures, and we will address that in greater
detail.
38 Business Intelligence
PARTNERING
Performance improvement can be motivated through measurement and reporting,
but the value of improving performance can only be achieved when all constituents work together. That being said, there are going to be times when different
participants’ perceptions of value differ, even though all participants are being
asked to contribute to the program success. But people are human, and it is
always going to be easier to engage individuals when they have a clear expectation of the value they will receive as a result. This concept must be applied
across the organization in a way that engages all participants by effectively
communicating each participant’s stake in both the short-term and the long-term
success of the program.
This implies that there is some incentive for everybody associated with the
project to achieve the specified goals. In a number of organizations I have observed,
two environments that conflict with the notion of a stake in success seem to prevail.
The first is the ‘‘What have you done for me lately?’’ mentality, which rewards
individual achievements accomplished within short-term periods. This attitude
encourages tactical steps at the expense of long-term strategy and stifles strategic
thinking. The second environment is the ‘‘inequitable risk/reward’’ mentality, where
individuals who have taken on added risk and have sacrificed short-term successes in
exchange for long-term strategy are overlooked when it comes to advances in
compensation or position, which in turn also discourages strategic thinking.
The success partnership should be designed so that short-term successes can be
engineered into a long-term strategy, where components of a BI strategy are
implemented in a sequence that provides ongoing value. In turn, all participants are
to be rewarded for meeting well-defined milestones and achieving specific goals
within reasonable deadlines. This is in contrast to the ‘‘big bang’’ approach, where
three years are spent building the all-encompassing environment and where all
centralized governance and business value becomes secondary to delivering
a complete, fully integrated enterprise data warehouse.
ESTABLISHING A VISION
A vision statement is a straightforward declaration describing how the control and
exploitation of actionable knowledge will add value to the organization. Those
organizations that are bound to this type of vision will best demonstrate execution of
strategy to gain competitive advantage.
Vision statements are precise and are crafted specifically for each organization
within each industry. For example, in the financial industry, it may be expressed in
terms of recognizing that the potential for increasing value lies in the most precise
and fastest analysis of financial information, followed by taking some action to
Planning for Success 39
exploit that advantage, such as in financial arbitrage. Another example might be the
retail industry, where the value vision is expressed as using information to
completely understand the customer, which in turn can lead to more effective targeted marketing, increased volume sales, reduced customer churn, and overall
improved customer satisfaction.
This vision embodies an agreement between the business management and the
technologists that long-term corporate information-based strategy is critical to the
future of a business and that synergy and cross-fertilizing technology and business
expertise will result in higher profits and lower costs for the business and in personal
rewards for all participants.
DEVELOPING A PLAN
A strategy translates the overall vision into a set of tactics for execution. A blueprint
provides a high-level guide to executing the strategy, and the BI roadmap will detail
the stages in which those concepts are brought to fruition. A good program manager
will adapt the roadmap into a program plan that details the resources, tasks, and
schedule for requirements analysis, design, validation of design, development,
implementation, and deployment to production.

Bridging the Gaps Between Information Technology
and the Business Users
If one of the success factors in gaining the best advantage from a BI and analytics
program is establishing a partnership between the business users and the information
technology team, what are the barriers between these two groups, and how can they
be overcome? To answer this question, we can look at how over time, the evolution of
technical resources has had an interesting influence on more than the speed at which
things get done.
There is what we might call a psychological effect on the way people work
together (or not) based on the allocation and distribution of technical resources. This
is reflected in the evolution of approaches for how technology development and
support has been linked to business applications in a relatively siloed manner. In the
early days of computing, all technical/business analysts shared time on huge
computers housed in separate rooms; the services provided were purely operationaldthere were no BI applications at all.
But as technology increasingly has become both smaller and more affordable,
there are corresponding changes in connecting technology to the business. For
example, the era of both the minicomputer (operating as a departmental resource) and
the personal computer, along with the trend of distributed computing, enabled some
40 Business Intelligence
degree of ‘‘self-service’’ that led to some operational efficiencies as well as some
degree of freedom. With a machine on his or her desktop, a business manager could
make use of desktop productivity tools for both operational and intelligence-oriented
processing; you no longer needed to be a scientific programmer carrying stacks of
punch cards to use computers. There was a need for technical support, and the concept
of the information technology department evolved into a technology development,
support, and evaluation organization, investigating new hardware and applications.
DICHOTOMY
On the other hand, the way the information technology department has evolved has
imposed an artificial boundary between those who require computer services and
those who provide those services. This is mostly because the ability to build userfriendly end-user applications has broken down the barrier to entry to exploiting
computers. In turn, there is a greater need for both technicians to solve problems with
computer use and those who can translate a business user’s problems into a collection
of technical issues. And although the way that these IT personnel were compensated
evolved into complicated charge-backs and accounting tricks, it was clear that the
division between business and IT is essentially a budgetary one: IT is usually a cost
center, as opposed to the business units, which are supposed to be profit centers. But
this split imposes a deeper philosophical division between information technology
providers and business users because the interaction framework is built around the IT
folks asking the business folks to support the IT initiatives (i.e., with money).
This is demonstrated by considering a typical exchange between developers and
business users: The implementers say, ‘‘We want to make improvements, but our
budget has been cut. How can we do this with no additional spending?’’ The business
users say, ‘‘We expected the data warehouse to be online already, but it is a year late and
over budget and is still unusable!’’ The implementers say, ‘‘We want to get the project
finished, but the requirements keep changing!’’ The users say, ‘‘The business environment continues to change, and what were requirements a year ago, when we first
planned the project, are no longer the same.’’ Clearly, the entities perceived as the ‘‘IT
side’’ and the ‘‘business side’’ have aligned themselves in an adversarial relationship.
Taking this interaction to its extreme, both sides are eventually dissatisfied, because
reduced budgets lead to missed deadlines and unmet business-side expectations.
PARTNERING
Fortunately, there is a growing knowledge overlap between the IT and business sides.
As the relationships between business units and IT groups grow, we find that the IT
side gradually learns more and more about how the business works and that the
business side has a growing understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the
Planning for Success 41
technology. These business people now understand more about the relationship
between business applications and the hardware, software, and developer resources
they require, and the technologists document and learn more about business process
modeling and how those processes can be encapsulated within an operational system.
This is a growing knowledge management trend that reflects the need for a deeper
understanding of how to exploit data and technology to gain a competitive edge.
One aspect of this trend is the abstraction of the components of the BI process.
Recurring themes such as business rule management, data governance, business
metadata and data lineage, workflow analysis, classification and segmentation, and
business process modeling are continually being introduced and refined within
frameworks for business/IT partnerships, effectively providing a way to formalize
and document the ground rules associated with the way the BI program will work, as
well as a means for planning the implementation of that program

Knowing the Different Types of Business Intelligence Users
There is increasing penetration of the results of data analytics and BI across the
organization to influence decision-making at many different management levels.
Understanding the reporting and analytics user community sheds light on the reliance on different types of analytic applications.
ANALYTIC DATABASES AND INFORMATION CONSUMERS
An insightful Forrester1 report in the mid 2000s suggested classifying information
consumer communities associated with BI as a way of assessing business needs for
reporting and analytics tools as well as qualifying suitability of BI tools to meet those
needs. While their characterization focused largely on consumers interacting directly
with the analytics products, we can provide an augmented classification of roles who
benefit from reporting and analysis engines:
n Power users, who constitute a community of experienced, sophisticated analysts
who want to use complex tools and techniques to analyze data and whose results
will inform decision-making processes.
n Business users, who rely on domain-specific reporting and analyses prepared by
power users, but who also rely on their own ad hoc queries and desire access to
raw data for drilling down, direct interaction with analytics servers (such as
OLAP tools or ‘‘mash-ups’’), extraction, and then further manipulation, perhaps
using desktop utility tools.
n Casual users, who may represent more than one area of the business, and rely on
rolled-up metrics from across functions or operational areas summarized from
predesigned reports presented via scorecards or dashboards.
42 Business Intelligence
n Data aggregators or Information providers, which are businesses that collect
industry- or societywide data and enhance and reorganize that data as a way of
providing value-added services to customers and subscribers. Some examples
include database marketing services, financial and credit information services,
real estate business information services, audience measurement services, market
research providers, and national statistical agencies, among others.
n Operational analytics users, who indirectly rely on the results of analytics
embedded within operational applications. Examples include call center representatives whose interactive scripts are adjusted interactively in relation to
customer profiles, predicted behavioral predispositions, and real-time customer
responses, web site offers and ad placement, or users of retail shelf management
systems that adjust stock levels based on demand across multiple regions.
n Extended enterprise users, composed of external parties, customers, regulators,
external business analysts, partners, suppliers, or anyone with a need for reported
information for tactical decision-making.
n IT users, mostly involved in the development aspects of BI, and whose use of BI
is more for supporting the needs of other information consumers.
Across levels of skill, management role, or even with customers outside the
enterprise, it is likely that information consumers benefit from the aggregation and
analysis of massive data sets. Increasingly, operational decision-making at all levels
of the organization is informed via notifications and alerts through a variety of
channels resulting from continuous pervasive BI and analysis, and in fact, the
analysis process itself is supplemented (e.g., customer profiling, classification, and
segmentation) using results computed

Strategic Versus Tactical Planning
If BI program failures are attributable to incomplete requirements and missed
expectations, then to succeed, we must strike a balance between aiming to meet the
long-term desires while satisfying the clients’ immediate needs in the short term.
LONG-TERM GOALS
The long-term strategy of a BI program involves building an analytical information
platform from which business value can be derived. The seamless enterprise BI
environment essentially is a factory to collect information from multiple sources,
prepare that data for use, aggregate it in a repository, provide analytical services,
and supply the means for accessing and viewing the results of those analytical
processes.
The appeal of this end state is its provision of the necessary business-oriented
functions that any particular vertical area could desire. Yet the inability to deliver the
entire package within a short amount of time limits the feasibility of a team’s
50 Business Intelligence
building the entire intelligence resource at one time. In fact, committing a large
amount of resources to a long-term project without identifiable short-term results is
the kind of risk that most senior-level managers are not likely to take.
Therefore, it is important to develop the end-state vision while keeping in mind
that short-term successes are critical. And designing the implementation plan with
those short-term value-adding deliverables in mind is more likely to lead to overall
success than the big-bang approach.
SHORT-TERM SUCCESS
The smart approach is to look for opportunities for short-term successes that conform
to the plan for reaching the end state. For example, if a business client anticipates
having a data mart populated from a data warehouse, it may not be necessary to
source the mart directly from a data warehouse. Instead, it may be possible to create
a data mart from the required data sources that satisfies the clients’ needs, and
providing the mart and the associated analytical and reporting components will yield
business value while not detracting from the strategic goal. Later, when the largescale repository is available, the data mart can be reconfigured to be sourced instead
from the repository. In this case, the client may see no difference in the analytical
environment, so having implemented the mart first is a short-term success that fits in
with the long-term goals.
Other ways to achieve short-term successes include aspects of the program that
will have auxiliary benefits. For example, a data cleansing effort that improves a data
set’s quality will benefit the current users of that data as well as the BI clients.
Funding and deploying a data quality effort will not only provide immediate value, it
will also provide a set of business processes and tools that can be leveraged for future
data cleansing projects.
Deciding which program components to deploy early in the plan should be
directly driven by client needs. It is possible that some work may need to be done in
the wrong logical order or perhaps may even need to be implemented twice. But if
this must be done to satisfy the senior-level sponsor, it is important to make sure
business clients are satisfied that their perceived intelligence needs are being met.

Strategic Versus Tactical Planning:

Long-Term Goals:

The long-term strategy of a BI program involves building an analytical information platform.
The seamless enterprise BI environment collects and prepares data, aggregates it, provides analytical services, and allows access to results.
The end state vision offers desired business-oriented functions but may not be feasible to deliver all at once.
Short-term successes are critical to gaining support from senior-level managers.

Short-Term Success:

Look for opportunities for short-term successes that align with the long-term plan.
Implement components that add value and contribute to the strategic goal.
Example: Creating a data mart from required data sources initially, and later reconfiguring it to be sourced from the data warehouse.
Auxiliary efforts like data cleansing provide immediate value and tools for future projects.
Deploy program components based on client needs, even if it requires working in the wrong logical order or implementing them twice.
Ensure client satisfaction by addressing their perceived intelligence needs.

Opportunity for Reuse:

Always look for opportunities to reuse tools, processes, metadata, or data sets.
Reuse can optimize resources, enhance efficiency, and support future initiatives.
