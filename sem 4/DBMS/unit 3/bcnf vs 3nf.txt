1.no transitive dependency                    In BCNF for any relation A->B, 
                                              A should be a super key of relation.

2.It is less stronger than BCNF.              It is comparatively more stronger than 3NF.

3.In 3NF the functional dependencies          In BCNF the functional dependencies 
  are already in 1NF and 2NF.                 are already in 1NF, 2NF and 3NF.

4.The redundancy is high in 3NF.              The redundancy is comparatively low in BCNF.

5.In 3NF there is preservation of             In BCNF there may or may not be preservation 
   all functional dependencies.               of all functional dependencies.

6.Lossless decomposition can be               Lossless decomposition is hard to achieve in BCNF.

7.It is comparatively easier to achieve.	It is difficult to achieve.

8.every 3nf table there may or may not         every bcnf table must be in 3f
