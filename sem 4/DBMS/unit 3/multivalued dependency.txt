Multivalued Dependency
**********************
Multivalued dependency occurs when two attributes in a table are independent 
of each other but, both depend on a third attribute.

A multivalued dependency consists of at least two attributes 
that are dependent on a third attribute that's why it always requires at least three attributes.

Example: Suppose there is a bike manufacturer company
which produces two colors(white and black) of each model every year.

BIKE_MODEL	MANUF_YEAR	COLOR
M2011		2008		White
M2001		2008		Black
M3001		2013		White
M3001		2013		Black
M4006		2017		White
M4006		2017		Black


Here columns COLOR and MANUF_YEAR are dependent on BIKE_MODEL and independent of each other.

In this case, these two columns can be called as multivalued dependent on BIKE_MODEL. 
The representation of these dependencies is shown below:

BIKE_MODEL   →  →  MANUF_YEAR  
BIKE_MODEL   →  →  COLOR  
This can be read as "BIKE_MODEL multidetermined MANUF_YEAR" and "BIKE_MODEL multidetermined COLOR".
