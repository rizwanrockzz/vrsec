What are the Anomalies in DBMS



Anomalies are problems that can occur in un-normalised databases.

There are different types of anomalies

Redundant storage: Some information is stored repeatedly.

Update anomalies: If one copy of such repeated data is updated, an
inconsistency is created unless all copies are similarly updated.

Insertion anomalies: It may not be possible to store some information unless
some other information is stored as well.

Deletion anomalies: It may not be possible to delete some information without
losing some other information as well.
