decomposition :
*************
The process of breaking up or dividing a single relation into two or more sub relations is
called as decomposition. 



properties:
***********
1. Lossless Decomposition
2. Dependency Preservation Decomposition

1. Lossless Decomposition
Decomposition must be lossless. It means that the information should not get lost 
from the relation that is decomposed.
It gives a guarantee that the join will result in the same relation as it was decomposed.

Example: <Employee_Department> Table

Eid	Ename	Age	City	Salary	Deptid	DeptName
E001	ABC	29	Pune	20000	D001	Finance
E002	PQR	30	Pune	30000	D002	Production
E003	LMN	25	Mumbai	5000	D003	Sales
E004	XYZ	24	Mumbai	4000	D004	Marketing
E005	STU	32	Bangalore25000	D005	Human Resource

Relation 1 : <Employee> Table

Eid	Ename	Age	City	Salary
E001	ABC	29	Pune	20000
E002	PQR	30	Pune	30000
E003	LMN	25	Mumbai	5000
E004	XYZ	24	Mumbai	4000
E005	STU	32	Bangalore25000

Relation 2 : <Department> Table

Deptid	Eid	DeptName
D001	E001	Finance
D002	E002	Production
D003	E003	Sales
D004	E004	Marketing
D005	E005	Human Resource

Employee â‹ˆ Department

Eid	Ename	Age	City	Salary	Deptid	DeptName
E001	ABC	29	Pune	20000	D001	Finance
E002	PQR	30	Pune	30000	D002	Production
E003	LMN	25	Mumbai	5000	D003	Sales
E004	XYZ	24	Mumbai	4000	D004	Marketing
E005	STU	32	Bangalore25000	D005	Human Resource


2. Dependency Preservation
**************************
Dependency is an important constraint on the database.
Every dependency must be satisfied by at least one decomposed table.
