4nf (fourth normal form)
************************
1.it is in bcnf 
2.no multivalued dependency

before 4nf
**********

Example: Suppose there is a bike manufacturer company
which produces two colors(white and black) of each model every year.

BIKE_MODEL	MANUF_YEAR	COLOR
M2011		2008		White
M2001		2008		Black
M3001		2013		White
M3001		2013		Black
M4006		2017		White
M4006		2017		Black


Here columns COLOR and MANUF_YEAR are dependent on BIKE_MODEL and independent of each other.

In this case, these two columns can be called as multivalued dependent on BIKE_MODEL. 
The representation of these dependencies is shown below:

BIKE_MODEL   →  →  MANUF_YEAR  
BIKE_MODEL   →  →  COLOR  
This can be read as "BIKE_MODEL multidetermined MANUF_YEAR" and "BIKE_MODEL multidetermined COLOR".


After 4nf
**********

BIKE_MODEL	MANUF_YEAR	
M2011		2008		
M2001		2008		
M3001		2013		
M4006		2017		

BIKE_MODEL	COLOR
M2011		White
M2001		Black
M3001		White
M3001		Black
M4006		White
M4006		Black
