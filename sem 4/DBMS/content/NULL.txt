NULL VALUES :
*************

The SQL NULL is the term used to represent a missing value. 
A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank.

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. 
It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces.

EXAMPLES :
**********
CREATE TABLE STUDENT(ROLLNO INT NOT NULL,
NAME VARCHAR(100)NULL);

insert into student values(1,NULL);
insert into student(rollno)values(2);
