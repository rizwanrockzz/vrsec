SQL GROUP BY Clause
*******************
The GROUP BY clause groups records into summary rows.
It returns one record for each group.
GROUP BY often include aggregates: COUNT, MAX, SUM, AVG,MIN etc.
A GROUP BY clause can group by one or more columns.

syntax
-----
SELECT column-names
  FROM table-name
 WHERE condition
 GROUP BY column-names

SELECT column-names
  FROM table-name
 WHERE condition
 GROUP BY column-names
 ORDER BY column-names

CUSTOMER: Id FirstName LastName City Country Phone

SELECT COUNT(Id), Country 
  FROM Customer
 GROUP BY Country


output:-
********
3	Argentina
2	Austria
2	Belgium
9	Brazil
3	Canada


SQL HAVING Clause
******************
The HAVING clause is like WHERE but operates on grouped records returned by a GROUP BY.
HAVING applies to summarized group records, whereas WHERE applies to individual records.
HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is present.
Both WHERE and HAVING can be used in the same query at the same time.
